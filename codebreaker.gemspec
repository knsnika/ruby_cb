                          The code-maker, which will be played by the application weâ€™re going to write,
                          creates a secret code of four numbers between 1 and 6.
                          The code-breaker then gets some number of chances to break the code.
                          In each turn, the code-breaker makes a guess of four numbers.
                          The code-maker then marks the guess with up to four + and - signs.}
